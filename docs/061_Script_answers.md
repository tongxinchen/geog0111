# Formative Assessment: Scripts : Answers to exercises

#### Exercise 1

* Create a Python code in a file called `work/greet.py` that does the following:
    - define a function `greet(name)` that prints out a greeting from the name in the argument  `name`
    - define a function `main() that passes a string from the script command line to a function `greet(name)`
    - calls `main()` if the file is run as a Python script 
    - show a test of the script working
    - has plentiful commenting and document strings
   
    - As a test, when you run the script:

            %run work/greet.py Fred

    you would expect to get a response of the form:

            greetings from Fred

    and if you run:
            %run work/greet.py Hermione

    then
            greetings from Hermione
    
* To go further with this exercise, you might test to see that the length of `sys.argv` is as long as you expect it to be, so you can tell the user when they forget toi include the name
* To go even further with this exercise, you might attempt to make the script function so that if you run it as:

        %run work/greet.py Fred Hermione
    
    it responds:

        greetings from Fred
        greetings from Hermione
