    "* Create a Python code in a file called `work/greet.py` that does the following:\n",
    "    - define a function `greet(name)` that prints out a greeting from the name in the argument  `name`\n",
    "    - define a function `main() that passes a string from the script command line to a function `greet(name)`\n",
    "    - calls `main()` if the file is run as a Python script \n",
    "    - show a test of the script working\n",
